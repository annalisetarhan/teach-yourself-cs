 This measurement is accurate to the microsecond and works by
 marking the time before and after a large number of system calls.
 It doesn't account for anything else the CPU does during that time.
 
 The average time for system calls is around 450 nanoseconds.

 Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be possible on macOS.

    thread placementâ€”explicit thread to processor binding is not supported."
(And nothing has changed since OS X became macOS.)
 
 Just for practice, I've implemented it anyway, but the result is meaningless.
